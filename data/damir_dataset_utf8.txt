"During the transition period between two operational states (including two different national operations) the supervision provided shall at least ensure the same protection provided by the least restrictive state. If an ETCS equipped train passes a level transition to a line fitted with more than one level, the onboard shall switch to the highest level, according to the priority given by trackside, for which it is equipped."
"If an ETCS equipped train passes a level transition to a line fitted with more than one level, the onboard shall switch to the highest level, according to the priority given by trackside, for which it is equipped. If an ETCS equipped train passes a level transition to one or more levels for which it is not equipped, ETCS shall initiate a brake application."
"The target distance shall not be shown on the DMI unless selected by the driver. On request of the RBC, the driver shall have the possibility to confirm that the track ahead of him until the end of the on sight section is clear"
It shall be possible to define certain locations (e.g. tunnels) where speed increase is related to the front of the train. The braking curves shall ensure that the train complies with its speed requirements.
The release speed shall be indicated on the DMI. If the release speed is calculated on board it shall ensure that the train will stop before reaching the danger point
"The driver shall have the possibility to select the language, this does not concern non pre-defined texts sent from the trackside. A train shall be supervised to its static and dynamic train speed profiles."
"A train shall be supervised to its static and dynamic train speed profiles. Within the braking curve area, a warning shall be given to the driver to enable him to react and avoid intervention from ETCS equipment at least 5 sec. before the intervention."
After the acknowledgement the train shall be able to be driven backwards for a certain distance defined by national value The ETCS trainborne equipment shall transmit its own train identification to the RBC.
The system hardware shall be fixed and patched via an internet connection. Yoggie shall coordinate on future enhancement and features with our organization.
It shall be possible for the equipment to display the identity of the called or calling party in the form of a standard telephone number. It shall be possible to display the identity of the called or calling party as a textual description of their function.
"It shall be possible for the user to re-join the call which is on hold at any time. The network shall provide the ability to inform a user, who is involved in an existing call, of attempts by other users to contact them ."
"This section of the specification gives details of these core requirements, while sections 5, 6 and 7 detail requirements specific to each of the radio types. Three distinct mobile radio types are required, based on the type of role they will perform and the environment in which they will operate, as follows: (I) a) Cab radio for use by the driver of a train and/or by other on-train systems, eg ERTMS/ETCS; b) General purpose radio for general use by railway personnel; c) Operational radio for use by railway personnel involved in train operations such as shunting and trackside maintenance."
"In particular, EIRENE equipment could interfere with: (I) 5.1.1 This section identifies the functional requirements for the EIRENE Cab radio. It covers the functionality provided by the Cab radio, driver MMI and support to other on-train systems."
A Push-To-Talk function shall be provided for use during group calls. Picking up the handset shall transfer the communication to the handset and reduce the loudspeaker volume to its minimum level.
"Once connected, the driver shall be able to communicate with other driver(s) by using the Push-To-Talk button on the handset. An indication shall be provided to the driver as a reminder of the need to use the Push-To-Talk button on the handset if he wants to talk."
"A continuous visual and short audible indication (from 0 to 20 seconds, for trials: 5 seconds) that the emergency function has been activated shall be provided in the cab. Once the Railway emergency call is connected and the audible indication is finished, an indication shall be provided to the driver as a reminder of the need to use the Push- To-Talk button on the handset if he wants to speak."
"Upon activation of this function, the Cab radio shall provide the driver with a list of generic staff, eg: (M) 5.2.2.40 The driver shall then be prompted to select the train staff with which he wishes to communicate."
Automatic confirmation of receipt of Railway emergency calls will be used to provide a means of determining which trains have received a Railway emergency call (see section 13). The Cab radio shall provide a means for the driver to terminate calls which he is authorised to terminate (ie all calls except Railway emergency calls not initiated by the driver and shunting group calls).
"If the Cab radio is equipped with an additional security device, this audible indication may be muted for the drivers convenience. In this case, the security device alerts the driver if the link has failed or if it is cancelled."
"For voice calls using the Cab radio not involving the driver as a called or calling party, the driver shall have the possibility to listen to the audio output of the communication. For voice communications, if the driver picks up the handset, the radio shall allow him to join the communication"
"Manual network selection is suitable for crossing international borders. If directed network selection is implemented, input from the external device(s) shall initiate the network change regardless of the identity of the current network and how it was selected."
A means to override the currently registered train number shall be provided to the newly registering driver. The driver of the previously registered train shall be informed (by audible and visual indications) that his train number has been overridden by another driver.
"This shall be carried out by entering the train number (option 1 in 5.2.3.26). Non leading drivers shall be able to indicate to the system their location in the train during the registration procedure (2nd driver, 3rd driver etc)."
The Cab radio shall have a reconfigurable list of stored numbers that may be used to perform abbreviated dialling to named user identities. It shall be possible for the driver to find and display stored numbers and their information.
It shall be possible for the driver to find and display stored numbers and their information. It should be possible for the driver to store and overwrite numbers and their details in the Cab radio.
The radio equipment that will be mounted in rolling stock can be split into two classes: in-cab equipment and external equipment. Each type of equipment has slightly different requirements placed upon it in terms of EMC and climate.
This section identifies the functional requirements for General purpose radio. It covers the functionality to be provided by the General purpose radio and the man-machine interface (MMI) is also defined.
"The group identity of the voice group call (VBS or VGCS) shall be displayed. If the call is a broadcast call, the user shall be informed that he cannot speak as part of the broadcast call."
Reception of this call (if implemented) shall proceed as for a standard group or broadcast call except that a distinctive audible and visual indication shall be provided. The radio shall provide a means for the user to terminate calls which he is authorised to terminate (ie all calls except broadcast or group calls not initiated by the user).
Prompts and messages shall be capable of being displayed in at least 10 languages (each railway will choose which languages will be implemented). The user shall be able to select his preferred language for the display; this setting shall be retained by the radio.
"It shall be possible to register and deregister a functional number in the following way: 6.2.3.11 Where a change of functional number is required, it shall be possible for the user to initiate the change. Store/retrieve numbers and their details"
"Where a change of functional number is required, it shall be possible for the user to initiate the change. Store/retrieve numbers and their details 6.2.3.12 It shall be possible for the user to find and display stored numbers and their information."
It shall be possible for the user to find and display stored numbers and their information. It shall be possible for the user to store and/or overwrite numbers and their details in the radio
This section identifies the functional requirements for the EIRENE Operational radio. It covers the functionality to be provided by the Operational radio and the man-machine interface (MMI) is also defined.
"The group identity of the voice group call (VBS or VGCS) shall be displayed. If the call is a broadcast call, the user shall be informed that he cannot speak as part of the broadcast call."
Reception of this call shall proceed as for a standard group or broadcast call except that a distinctive audible and visual indication shall be provided. The radio shall provide a means for the user to terminate calls which he is authorised to terminate (ie all calls except broadcast or group calls not initiated by the user).
Prompts and messages shall be capable of being displayed in at least 10 languages (each railway will choose which languages will be implemented). The user shall be able to select his preferred language for the display; this setting shall be retained by the radio.
"It shall be possible to register and deregister a functional number in the following way: 7.2.3.11 Where a change of functional number is required, it shall be possible for the user to initiate the change. Store/retrieve numbers and their details"
"Where a change of functional number is required, it shall be possible for the user to initiate the change. Store/retrieve numbers and their details 7.2.3.12 It shall be possible for the user to find and display stored numbers and their information."
It shall be possible for the user to find and display stored numbers and their information. It shall be possible for the user to store and/or overwrite numbers and their details in the radio.
The Operational radio shall comply with the basic standards defined for all EIRENE mobile equipment in section 4.3 and this section. The Operational radio is specified to allow its use in the operating environment experienced on the operational railway (eg shunting and maintenance).
It should be possible to release the carry feature instantly in the event that the radio is caught on a projecting part of a moving vehicle. Controls shall be designed such that they are suitable for use by people wearing gloves.
"It should be possible for calls to be answered automatically according to incoming call priority as defined in section 10.2. The functionality required by other types of controllers is essentially the same as for primary controllers, but the control area will differ and the call set-up subsystem may be integrated into their own function management system."
Yes* indicates that the call shall be allowed at least for users on the same train. Open indicates that permissions for calls of this type are to be assigned by the implementing railway according to their specific communication requirements.
The addressing scheme can be divided into two areas: (I) 11.2.1.1 An addressing scheme shall be provided which permits users to be identified by numbers corresponding to their functional roles rather than by numbers tied to the terminal equipment that they are using.

"The functional number registration facility shall be supported by all EIRENE user equipment. It should be possible for the system to prevent certain types of users from registering functional numbers that they are not authorised to use, for example: (O)"
"The location dependent addressing scheme shall be available to all mobiles. As a minimum, the location information used by the EIRENE system shall be derived from that available from the network itself (eg current cell or base station serving the mobile)."
The performance of the confirmation procedure shall not be dependent upon the current use of the mobile and shall not overload the network. Shunting mode is the term used to describe the application that will regulate and control user access to facilities and features in the mobile while it is being used for shunting communications.
"There is a requirement to regulate the membership of shunting groups to prevent uncontrolled membership. During specific shunting operations where the driver is not able to see the way ahead and where he is therefore relying on information from another shunting member, a link assurance signal is needed to provide reassurance during silent periods that the radio link is still established."
"In the latter case, in order to avoid disturbing a shunting movement, the shunting leader should be informed by a visual and audible indication. The shunting leader can then choose the moment when he takes or rejects the call."
"This means will consist of an additional safety device (external to the radio system) interposed between the Cab radio and the loudspeaker with the purpose of muting the continuous link assurance signal for the drivers convenience. In this case, the safety device will alert the driver only if the link assurance signal has failed or if it is cancelled."
"All members of the shunting group, other than the initiator of the link assurance signal, shall be unable to speak during the transmission of the link assurance signal. However, they shall be able to initiate a shunting emergency call at any time."
"The System must keep an unalterable audit trail capable of automatically capturing and storing information about: Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them ."
"Once the audit trail functionality has been activated, the System must track events without manual intervention, and store in the audit trail information about them. The System must maintain the audit trail for as long as required, which will be at least for the life of the case to which it refers."
"This functionality can be used by external auditors who wish to examine or analyse system activity. The System must be able to capture and store violations (i.e. A userƒ??s attempts to access a case to which he is denied access), and (where violations can validly be attempted) attempted violations, of access control mechanisms."
"The System must allow changes to security attributes for groups or users (such as access rights, security level, privileges, password allocation and management) to be made only by super-user. If a user requests access to, or searches for, a case which he does not have the right to access, the System must provide one of the following responses (selectable at configuration time):"
"Any access to cases, and all other activities involving the cases and related documents or data should also need to be stored in the audit trail to ensure legal admissibility and to assist in data recovery. All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them."

All error messages produced by the System must be meaningful, so that they can be appropriately acted upon by the users who are likely to see them ."
The System must allow persistent defaults for data entry where desirable. These defaults should include: Frequently-executed System transactions must be designed so that they can be completed with a small number of interactions (e.g. mouse clicks).
"Where the System employs a graphical user interface, it must allow users to customise it. Customisation should include, but need not be limited to the following changes: The user interfaces should be designed to make them user-intuitive."
Software accessibility ISO 9241-171 shall be the standard for guidance on software accessibility. User interfaces should meet its requirements and recommendations.
"Providing text equivalents for non-text media objects: All non-text media objects, such as graphical images or video, should be provided with alternative equivalent textual descriptions and/or with equivalent text-based functionality. Making navigation self-descriptive: Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next."
"Navigation should be designed to help users understand where they are, where they have been and where they can go next."
General guidance on achieving self-descriptiveness is given in ISO 9241-110. Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.

Showing users where they are: Each presentation segment (page or window) should provide the user with a clear and sufficient indication of where he or she is in the navigation structure and of the current segment position with respect to the overall structure.
"The number of navigation steps needed to reach a certain piece of content should be minimized as long as different mental models, navigation strategies and tasks of the user are taken into account. Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user."
"Splash screens should be avoided unless they provide useful content or feedback about the application state to the user. If a splash screen is used, a navigation option to skip it should be offered."
"Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They can superimpose the primary window, hiding relevant information."
"Opening new windows can distract, confuse or impede users for a variety of reasons. They also require additional user actions for closing unwanted windows."
"Users expect error messages to be in the same language as the user interface. Using appropriate formats, units of measurement or currency: When designing user interfaces for use by diverse groups, input and output of information elements such as currency, units of measurement, temperatures, date and time, phone numbers, address or postal codes should be designed so that they are usable."
"Avoiding link overload: Text pages containing large proportions of links should be formatted so that the presence of links does not impede the readability of the text. Using familiar terminology for navigation links: Navigation links ƒ?? particularly links representing the main navigation structure ƒ?? should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his /her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems."

"Navigation links ƒ?? particularly links representing the main navigation structure ƒ?? should be labelled with terms that are familiar to the user, based on his/her general knowledge, prior experience in the application domain or experience of using other systems. Using descriptive link labels: The target or purpose of a link should be directly indicated by its label, avoiding generic labels such as ƒ??goƒ? or ƒ??click hereƒ? except where the purpose of the link is clear from its context on the page or the labels have commonly understood semantics in the particular application domain."
"If a document is either too long, dispersed over several pages or in a specific layout that is not suitable for online reading, a printer-friendly version of the document should be provided that prints the content in a form acceptable to the user (e.g. in the expected layout, paper format, or orientation). Use of ƒ??white spaceƒ?: ƒ??White spaceƒ? on a page i.e. space filled only with the background color should be used in such a way that it does not impair the visual skimming of the page."
"If frames are used, care should be taken to avoid possible problems, for example, those involving the use of the back button, bookmarking of pages, or scrolling of information. When frames are used, it is important to title each frame, and to describe its purpose and how frames relate to one another other."
"User adaptation can also be important for making the user interface more accessible. Different approaches can be used for achieving these goals, like providing users with means for customizing the user interface to their personal needs i.e. individualization designing content and navigation differently for varying user groups or roles i.e. such as employees of different levels, citizens etc, monitoring the userƒ??s behaviour and adapting to the userƒ??s goals that are inferred from the behaviour observed, recommending information that is potentially more relevant or interesting to the specific user, based on the behaviour of all users or a user group."
"If predefined user profiles or user-specified profiles are used for individualizing or adapting content, the profile currently used should be made evident. If profiles are used, it is important to provide users with information about this concept and its implications."
"In this context, performing a search means returning a result list. It does not include retrieving the records themselves ."
